## Over-inspired

> This is very much a COVID19 moonshot unique problem. Namely, the cases of excess inspiration fragments.

The 'TRY-UNI-714a760b-1' compound (`Cc1c(N)cncc1NC(=O)CC1CCCCC1`) is purposed to be inspired by x0107, x0434, x0678, x0748, x0995, x1382.

This takes forever to make a template... which comes out awful.

When placed and minimised the compound drifts off. The reason for this is that there are only two atoms that map.

In reality only x0107, x0678, x0995 were the true inspirations. When this is corrected, the scaffold is basically the followup.

So the question is: how does one fix this?
Before that it is best to see how frequent this is:

Of the 2,000 with 1 hit as inspiration, 500 are based upon x0072.
These are not really inspirations, just a case where `null` was not a choice.
