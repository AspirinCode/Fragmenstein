# Covid and Fragmenstein

Fragmenstein was sparked to life by COVID Moonshot project [the COVID moonshot project](https://discuss.postera.ai/c/covid).
[This dataset](https://github.com/postera-ai/COVID_moonshot_submissions) has some unique peculiarities that potentially
are not encountered in other projects. Namely, humans look at the bound fragments and suggest followups via the form.
However, there are some problems:

* the form does not have a `no inspiration hit` option, so many users submitted `x0072` the first as inspiration when submitting docked libraries.
* the inspiration hits are common to a group of submissions by a user, even if one went into one and another to another.
* some pockets have many hits, so a large amount of not fully overlapping hits are submitted
* some users submitted a mispelt hit
